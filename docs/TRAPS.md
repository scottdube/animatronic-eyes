## Stop on the page only lasts 20 s (2026-09-24)
`/scene?cmd=stop` sets mode rest and counts as activity, so with idleMode 1 idle restarts after autoIdleSecs
(20 s). Stop is not a hold. To keep the eyes still, set idleMode 0 live (don't Save it). Candidate fix, not
done: have stop set holdRest so auto idle waits for the controller, presence or another command.

## A timed idle run never really ends in automatic mode (read from code 2026-09-25, not observed)
Triangle / page Idle / radar arrival run idle for idleRunMins (5), then drop to rest. But with idleMode 1,
nobody has touched anything for 5 min, so "unattended" is already true and auto idle restarts on the next loop.
The timer only has an effect when idleMode is 2 (manual only). Same root as the page-Stop trap above.
